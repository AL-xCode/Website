# Website

This is my website to pratice web development. I focus on building new skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I am going to add additonal functionality as I learn.

The ultimate goal of this website will to have each link contain the resources I learned in all fields of tech. I would like to become a cross-functional developer with knowledge of front-end and back-end processes as well as knowledge of additonal areas like data analytics and UX design.

I will eventually publish via GitPages.
